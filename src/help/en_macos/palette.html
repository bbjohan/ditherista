        <h1>Palette Settings</h1>
        <div id="bodytext">
            The <u>Palette</u> tab allows defining color palettes for both Mono and Color dithering.
        </div>

        <h1>Mono Palette Settings</h1>
        <div id="bodytext">
            In the <u>Mono Palette</u> section you can pick different colors than just black and white for mono dithering.
            Pressing the <u>X</u> button resets the colors to black and white.
        </div>

        <h1>Color Palette Settings</h1>
        <div id="bodytext">
            The palette and the color comparison method play a very important role when it comes to the quality of
            color dithering. The better the target palette matches the different colors and brightness of the source
            image, the better the dithering result will be.<p>

            <u>Palette source</u> - lets you pick the target palette the dithered image should use:
            <ul>
                <li><u>built-in</u>: allows you to choose a pre-defined palette, such as used in classic computer
                    systems and video game consoles.</li>
                <li><u>from file</u>: allows you to load a Paint.NET compatible palette. You can get such palettes
                    from <a href="https://lospec.com">lospec.com</a> or create your own using a text editor.</li>
                <li><u>reduced</u>: creates a palette with a limited amount of colors from the current image.</li>
                <li><u>custom</u>: this entry will become visible when a color of the target palette has been edited.</li>
            </ul>

            <u>Color comparison</u> - lets you pick a method to match the source image's original pixel colors to the
            next closest color in the target palette (as chosen in <u>Palette source</u>):
            <ul>
                <li><u>LAB '76</u>: A fairly fast method using the LAB color space. Sometimes the results are good
                    but for best quality pick LAB '94 or LAB 2000.</li>
                <li><u>LAB '94</u>: A method offering a good balance between speed and quality, using the LAB color space.</li>
                <li><u>LAB 2000</u>: Offers the best quality in situations where the reduced palette matches the original
                    palette well. Can be slow.</li>
                <li><u>sRGB</u>: The best all-around color matching method, using the sRGB color space.</li>
                <li><u>sRGB CCIR</u>: Same as <u>sRGB</u>. Takes human perception into account. Sometimes better than sRGB.</li>
                <li><u>HSV</u>: Uses the HSV color space. May not work properly with small palettes where the colors do
                    not match the source image well.</li>
                <li><u>Luminance</u>: A great choice for uniform color palettes with a color gradients. Color matching is
                    less accurate than in other methods, but it get very pretty looking results with a gradient palette.</li>
                <li><u>Linear</u>: Compares colors in linear space; generally not recommended, but may work well for
                    palettes which have few colors and do not match the source image's palette well.</li>
                <li><u>Linear CCIR</u>: Same as <u>Linear</u> but takes human perception into account.</li>
                <li><u>Tetrapal</u>: A method intended for ordered dithering, but it also works for other dithering approaches.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h1>Loading Palettes from File</h1>
        <div id="bodytext">
            When the <u>Palette source</u> is set to <u>from file</u>, you can press the <u>Browse</u> button and load a
            Paint.NET compatible palette file. You can get such palettes from <a href="https://lospec.com">lospec.com</a>
            or create your own using a text editor.</li>
            You can also type or paste the path to a Paint.NET palette file into the text field next to the <u>Browse</u>
            button.
        </div>

        <h1>Creating a Reduced Palette</h1>
        <div id="bodytext">
            When the <u>Palette source</u> is set to <u>reduced</u> you can specify the number of colors your target palette
            should have into the input field next to <u>Colors</u>. You can then choose a <u>Color reduction mode</u>:
            <ul>
                <li><u>Median Cut</u>: The best all-around method. It's fast and generally quite accurate.</li>
                <li><u>Wu</u>: Often gives better results than Median Cut, but not always. It's also slower.</li>
                <li><u>KD-Tree</u>: Generally gives better results than Median Cut. It's the slowest method.</li>
            </ul>

            In some cases, for example when the number of target colors is low, the target palettes colors may not be
            well distributed. In this case you can turn on <u>Count unique pixels</u>. This will not just take into account
            the overall number of unique colors in the source image, but also how many pixels there are of each color. Note
            that this makes the color reduction slower!<p>

            In some cases, for example when the number of target colors is low, it can help to explicitly include extreme
            colors, e.g. very dark, very bright, very blue, very red, etc. colors:
            <ul>
                <li><u>Include brightest / darkest</u>: includes the 2 colors from the source image that are closest to pure white and pure black, if there is space in the target palette.</li>
                <li><u>Include max RGB colors</u>: includes the 3 colors from the source image that are closest to pure red, green and blue, if there is space in the target palette.</li>
                <li><u>Include max CMY colors</u>: includes the 3 colors from the source image that are closest to pure cyan, magenta and yellow, if there is space in the target palette.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h1>Color Swatches and Palette Editing</h1>
        <div id="bodytext">
            The color swatches are a powerful way to preview and edit the colors of a palette used for dithering.
            You can edit the swatches the following ways:
            <ul>
                <li>Double-click on a swatch or onto a hex color label to bring up a color picker dialog. You can also
                    open the dialog by right-clicking onto a swatch and choosing <u>edit color</u>.</li>
                <li>Right-click on a swatch and choose <u>copy color</u> to copy a color's hex value to the clipboard.
                    The color data in the clipboard is just a piece of text, e.g. "#FFFF0000 for red.</li>
                <li>Right-click and choose <u>paste color</u> to copy a color's hex value from the clipboard and to change
                    the color. You are not limited to copy colors within Ditherista. You can copy color values from e.g.
                    a text editor too, and paste them into Ditherista. You can also copy colors between the <u>Color
                    Palette</u> and <u>Mono Palette</u> sections.</li>
            </ul>
            When edited, a new entry named <u>custom</u> will appear in the <u>Palette source</u> drop down.
            <p>
            The hex color values used consist 4 channels: alpha (i.e. transparency), red, green and blue.
        </div>

        <h1>Custom Palette Export</h1>
        <div id="bodytext">
            When you edit colors of a palette, the resulting new palette will be available under the <u>custom</u>
            entry in the <u>Palette source</u> drop down.<p>
            There is also a button <u>save palette</u> which lets you save your custom palette as Paint.NET file.
